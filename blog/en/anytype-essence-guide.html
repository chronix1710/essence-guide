            <h1 class="block-heading1">Abstract</h1>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Hi! I'm have been in Anytype community for several months and I can sense the general consensus that Anytype is difficult to grasp at the same time Anytype's documentation is far from perfect. So, I have decided to make an all-in-one Anytype tutorial as well as to share everything I know about Anytype.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This tutorial is up-to-date with <span class="text-bold">Anytype version 0.51.x</span>. I cannot guarantee that the information in this guide holds accurate if Anytype releases newer version. However, I believe the core idea of this guide will still be helpful in the far future.</p>
            <p class="block-callout callout-note">Please note that the following sections are purely the author's personal opinion from a perspective of an Anytype's user. <span class="text-bold">THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT Anytype's VIEW ON ITS OWN IN ANY WAYS. I am not affiliated with Anytype in any ways.</span></p>
            
            <h1 class="block-heading1">Background</h1>
            <p class="block-paragraph">OK, let's establish the background first. I have been a Notion user and Obsidian user for a long time. Recently, I switched to Anytype for privacy and synchronization purpose. To be honest, I have been using Anytype for only 3 months. However, I spent 8 - 10 hours daily watching tutorials, exploring features, creating, and deleting a lot of spaces. I have also made two templates (in the word of Anytype: "experience") for the 2 most popular use case. You can check it out on Anytype Experience Gallery:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype-essence-pkm.png" alt="Essence PKM - Anytype experience">
                <figcaption>Anytype - Essence PKM (<a href="https://gallery.any.coop/?experience=essence_pkm" target="_blank">https://gallery.any.coop/?experience=essence_pkm</a>) - a good experience to start your PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) journey that comes with detailed methodology.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype-essence-tkm.png" alt="Essence TKM - Anytype experience">
                <figcaption>Anytype - Essence TKM (<a href="https://gallery.any.coop/?experience=essence_tkm" target="_blank">https://gallery.any.coop/?experience=essence_tkm</a>) - a TKM (Technological Knowledge Management) experience for tech consumers and developers to learn digital knowledge, collect tech, and manage to project.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Therefore, I think I am experienced enough to write a decent tutorial so don't worry that it would a waste of time to read. With that said, I am happily open to any suggestions, questions, and corrections.</p>
            <p class="block-callout callout-warning">The built-in "Help" tutorial in those experiences may contain some outdated parts which I recommend you refer to this guide instead.</p>

            <h1 class="block-heading1">Knowledge</h1>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Let's get straight to the point. There are two main things to know in order to use Anytype efficiently. They are <span class="text-bold">Organization</span> (how you organize your information) and <span class="text-bold">Navigation</span> (how you access your information).</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Organization</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">In this part, you will learn how Anytype stores and organizes your information.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">If you want to write down information about virtually anything and want to store it neatly for later retrieval, Anytype is such a tool. However, Anytype cannot know what you are going to write about so it needs to model, or to simply put, a blueprint of things and the way to organize those things. I will refer to this as "architecture", an organization method.</p>
            <p class="block-callout callout-note">Remember that you ultimately decide what to write and how to organize. The result is mostly affected by your choice and it should only be capped by the ceiling of Anytype's functionalities, not your imagination.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">The architecture has 3 layers: <span class="text-bold">outer layer</span>, <span class="text-bold">middle layer</span>, and <span class="text-bold">inner layer</span>.</p>
            <h3 class="block-heading3">The outer layer</h3>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The outer layer is easy to understand.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">All of your information exists in a thing called <code class="text-highlight">Vault</code>, which has a passphrase to protect. The vault is linked to an <code class="text-highlight">Account</code> so that Anytype can attach subscription, cloud storage, and synchronization between devices. Inside a vault, there is <code class="text-highlight">Space</code>, which can be shared with others. Data inside a space doesn't interact with data in other spaces.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_the-outer-layer.png" alt="Anytype's the outer layer">
                <figcaption>
                    <span class="text-bold">The outer layer</span>. Above is the list of <code class="text-highlight">Space</code> in the <code class="text-highlight">Vault</code>. Below is the <code class="text-highlight">Account</code>.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3 class="block-heading3">The middle layer</h3>
            <p class="block-paragraph">When you enter a <code class="text-highlight">Space</code>, you enter its middle layer. This is where things get messy.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You are probably informed about concepts like <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Query</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Widget</code> in this layer on Anytype's documentation and possibly wonder about ambiguous concepts like <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Page</code>, <code class="text-highlight">List</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Set</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Bookmark</code>. I will explain them later.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">First, I guess you are probably familiar with concepts like <code class="text-highlight">File</code> and <code class="text-highlight">Folder</code> on Operating System or on other note-taking apps. I will use this as an analogy. This is the traditional way of storing information. Let's say you can pack information into a file. However, a file cannot contain another file so we need something that can contain file and others, which includes itself. It is a folder.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/obsidian_file-storage-approach.png" alt="Obsidian's file storage approach">
                <figcaption>
                    How <a href="https://obsidian.md/"><span class="text-bold"> Obsidian</span></a> (a popular note-taking app) stores information using <code class="text-highlight">File</code> and <code class="text-highlight">Folder</code> similar to operating system.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">However, you will soon run into a problem. Information is not file, they are related to each other. They can contain one another, have multiple parents, have multiple children or even worse be both a parent and a child of another. For example, if you were classifying food, how would you fit tomato? Under fruit folder? Under vegetables folder? If stored under both, you will have duplicate information. You could think of a quick solution: "What if I link (create a shortcut of) them to other locations?". This does not avoid another bigger problem you will encounter that is "What if you need to move the folder or change the entire hierarchy?". No matter where you store the file, there will eventually be a need for moving them and when those needs come, expect some troubles.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Anytype's approach to this repository problem is to store all files under one or several big fixed folder, that one is the <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code> of the space you see at the home screen of Anytype).</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_graph-object.png" alt="Anytype's Graph">
                <figcaption>
                    The <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code> of every space. It is accessible through the immediate top right button of the right panel.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Then we define the hierarchy by creating relationships between those files and put all of those derivative information in subsequent folders. For example, we have three things: tomato, vegetable, fruit. I have a folder named "objects" to store the those three objects. I can now simply create 2 relationships: <span class="text-italic">Tomato is Fruit</span> and <span class="text-italic">Tomato is Vegetables</span> and put them in a folder named "relations". This is precisely what Anytype does if you unpack any exported spaces.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_file-storage-approach.png" alt="Anytype's file storage approach">
                <figcaption>
                    The contents of any unpacked Anytype exported spaces. <span class='text-bold'>Objects</span> are put in the folder "objects". <span class='text-bold'>Files</span> (any things you upload like images, videos, documents) are put in the folder "files". <span class='text-bold'>Relationships</span> between objects are put in the folder "relations". <span class='text-bold'>Properties</span> of objects are put in the folder "relationsOptions". <span class='text-bold'>Templates</span> (different blueprints for objects in types) are put in the folder "templates". <span class='text-bold'>Types</span> (reusable blueprints for objects) are put in the folder "templates". <span class='text-bold'>Information</span> about the space itself is represented by the file "profile".
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">From now on, whenever I say something contains something that mean it contains the link to that thing.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This approach is called <span class="text-bold">Object-oriented</span> (the term some other note-taking apps advertise themselves as), in contrast to the <span class="text-bold">Directory tree (Folder & File)</span>, which have been deeply entrenched in operating system users for years. That's why I believe most of Anytype's users find themselves incredibly disoriented when they navigate throughout the app.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This is analogous to the concept of graph in mathematics. The <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> is vertex, the <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> is weight, and the <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> is edge. The only difference is that there are only 2 kinds of relations in Anytype's graph which is link (which object is linked to which object) and type (which object belong to which type). They are respectively represented by a line without label and one-way arrow with the label "Object type" when you hover the object on the Anytype's graph.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_relation-on-graph.png" alt="Anytype's file storage approach">
                <figcaption>
                    <code class='text-highlight'>Relation</code> on <code class='text-highlight'>Graph</code>. "Objec type" relationship (which object belong to which type) is represented by orange lines with an arrow pointing to the type and the label "Object type". "Link" relationship (which object is linked to which object) is represented by orange line without arrows and label.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Now back to other concepts. So, basically every piece of information is an <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>. Objects can have <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> with each other. Each object has some <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> (think of "metadata") - additional information about that object that exists along with the object itself (not inside the object). Those are the three basic entities that exist in Anytype. From now, when I refer to Entity, the term I come up on my own, what I mean is one of those three.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">We have understood <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code>. Now let's learn the next easy one: Property. <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> can be user-defined (we can create it on our own) - <code class="text-highlight">User Properties</code> and system-defined (dynamic things like dates, links,… which we can't manually input or delete) <code class="text-highlight">System Properties</code>. When you go <code class="text-highlight">Anytype → Settings → Space → Properties</code> you will see that they are separated.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_two-kind-of-property.png" alt="Anytype's two kind of property">
                <figcaption>
                    Two kinds of <code class='text-highlight'>Property</code> - <code class='text-highlight'>User Properties</code> ("My properties" in the picture) & <code class='text-highlight'>System Properties</code> - are separated.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Every <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> has one and only one <code class="text-highlight">Class</code> (I know I can use the term "Type" here but I don't want you to be confused with "Type" of <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>). Once a <code class="text-highlight">Class</code> is set for a <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>, it cannot be changed.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_property-class.png" alt="Anytype's property class">
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">There are different kinds of Class:</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
            <li><span class="text-bold">Object</span>: Property has the value of none or more than zero objects whose Type belongs to a pre-defined list of Type. You can modify this list of Type.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Text</span>: Property has the value of text.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Number</span>: Property has the value of number. It can be whole number or decimal number. It can be positive number of negative number. When it's empty, it is considered as zero.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Select</span>: Property has none or one value that belongs to a pre-defined list of options. The value of options is text.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Multi-select</span>: Property has none or more than zero values that belongs to a pre-defined list of options. The value of options is text.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Date</span>: Property has the value of date. The date value can also accompany a time value if users enable "include time".</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">File & Media</span>: Property has the value of none or more than zero objects whose Type belongs to a pre-defined list of Type which consists of Image, Audio, Video, File. This is a shorthand version of the class "Object" as you don't need to manually add all the related types.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Checkbox</span>: Property has the value of either checked or unchecked. This is a useful property for objects like tasks.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">URL</span>: Property has none or a valid URL.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Email</span>: Property has none or a valid email address.</li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Phone</span>: Property has none or a valid phone number.</li></ul>
            <p class="block-paragraph">We have understood <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>. Now let's talk about the final boss: <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>. As I have mentioned, there are 2 kinds of <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> on <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code>. This give rise to 2 (I know you are probably wondering that you heard like 10 different types of objects but stay with me) basic kinds of Object. <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> that is pointed to by the arrow with the label "Object" is called <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. The other <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> kind on the other side of the arrow without label is called <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code> (this is another term I come up with for the sake of being accurate and distinguishable). There exist other Object kinds which are neither <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> nor <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code>.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Every existing <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> (not just Instance) must have a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> and belong to only one <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. This even applies to <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> itself. All <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> objects belong to the ultimate object named "Type". They are reflected by a system <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> called "Object type". Once an <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> is created with a certain user <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, you cannot change its "Object type" as it is a system property.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">Now, let's focus on <span class="text-bold">Format</span>. This is a troublesome part of Anytype because some people misunderstand this as another Object type which they are not and most importantly, it cannot be changed once a user <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> is created so think carefully. There are 2 kinds of Format:</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li><p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Page</span>: the information of an Instance is organized like a regular document (similar to Microsoft Word, Google Docs,…). If you want to link it to other Object, you just need to insert the link anywhere in the document. When Page is selected, the options for Layout are:</p>
                <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Layout type</span>: has 4 options. "Basic" means the icon of all instances can be Emoji or user-uploaded Picture. "Profile" means the icon of all instances can only be user-uploaded Picture. "Action" means there is a checkbox (suitable for task) instead of icon. "Note" means there is no icon and no header (the content of the object becomes the header).</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Header position</span>: pretty self-explanatory. It comes with three options: "Left", "Right", and "Center".</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Properties view</span>: also self-explanatory. It comes with two options. "List" means the list of properties you want to display in the header are on the same line. "Line" means each property of the list of properties you want to display in the header is on separate line.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Layout</span> width: how wide the content of the Instance should be. It comes with a scale from 100% to 200%.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">List</span>: Why would you need this format? Well, for Page, you can view the information about an Object when you enter it, but what if I want to view all of its Property and additionally, not just one but two, ten, hundreds of objects' Property at the same time for visualization. This is where List comes in handy. The concept is similar to both "Folder" and "Database" at the same time. When you choose this format, you don't want to enter any information about this object as there is no empty space for you to type your information. Instead, you care about the properties of the objects inside this object. Just like any objects, objects with "List" format can link to other objects, including objects with "List" format themselves (note that I use Object not just Instance). Unlike objects with "Page" format, the linked objects only show up once and are organized in a List (default way but there are other ways for organization), hence the name "List".</p>

They can be name, price, SKU, arrival date, availability,… At high level, they might have different properties based on their nature. Shirts, shoes,… may need "Size".

In fact, Anytype offers a feature that you can turn any Query object into <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> object. So, why do we need another kind of Type? Imagine this scenario. You want to view and organize all Objects that have Property related time. Those can be the "deadline" of "Work assignment" objects, the "submission date" of "Schoolwork" objects, the "arrival date" of "Shopping order" objects, the "observation date" of "Holidays" objects, the "Due date" of "Finance terms" objects,… Sure, you can create a <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> object to link all of them but don't you think it's tedious to manually include them manually every time you create a new object which has time-sensitive <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>. Plus, you have to make sure that you don't leave anything out and start from the beginning. This is where <code class="text-highlight">Query</code> comes to the rescue! <code class="text-highlight">Query</code> objects automatically link objects based on properties in Filter while you have to manually link objects in <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> objects and the Filter of Collection objects only work on those manually linked objects. <code class="text-highlight">Query</code> are also useful because you can insert them into the document of objects with "Format" of "Page" (which will be explained in the inner layer).</li>

Widgets can be expanded to show its linked objects (the maximum numbers of linked objects to be shown are 6, 10, 14, 30, and 50) or collapsed. Every widget has name, icon and a view. There exist 4 different views in total: "Object view" (display linked objects' names and icons exactly how objects with "Format" of "List" display their linked objects; objects are put in tiles and each line contains 2 tiles), "Compact list view" (display each linked object's name and icon on a separate line), "List view" (display each linked object' name, icon, and short description on two lines), "Compact widget view" (do not display any linked objects). Should the number of linked objects exceeds the configured maximum number, there is a small button called "See all" which takes you to fully expanded list of linked objects inside the panel. Widgets of objects with "Format" of "Page" have only 2 kinds of views available: "Object view" and "Compact widget view". All widgets exist in two subpanels "<span class="text-bold">Pinned</span>" and "<span class="text-bold">Objects</span>", which can be expanded or collapsed. "Pinned" subpanels are for objects which you have manually pinned them. "Objects" subpanels for objects which are automatically pinned by the systems.

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Summary</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Watch out for the following bullet train!</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>There are 2 aspects to learn about Anytype. <span class="text-bold">Organization</span> tells you how information is organized and <span class="text-bold">Navigation</span> tells you how to access information.</li>
                <li>Organization has 3 layers: <span class="text-bold">Outer layer</span>, <span class="text-bold">Middle layer</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Inner layer</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Outer layer</span> is where <code class="text-highlight">Account</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Vault</code>, and <code class="text-highlight">Space</code> exist. Vault contains all of your information with passphrase protection. The vault is linked to an <code class="text-highlight">Account</code> for attached subscription, network, and synchronization. <code class="text-highlight">Vault</code> contains <code class="text-highlight">Space</code>. Data inside a space doesn't interact with data in other spaces.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Middle layer</span> exists inside <code class="text-highlight">Space</code> is the most important layer. Information is organized based on the <span class="text-bold">Object-oriented</span> approach. Everything information exists on a <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code>. Instead of using folders to contain, information is linked with each other. Depending on its nature, every piece of information is put in subsequent folders: <span class="text-bold">files</span>, <span class="text-bold">objects</span>, <span class="text-bold">relations</span>, <span class="text-bold">relationOptions</span>, <span class="text-bold">templates</span>, <span class="text-bold">types</span>.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Object</code> represents the thing you want to take note of in real life. Objects can have <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> with each other. Each object has some <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> which adds additional information about that object that exists along with the object itself (not inside the object). The term <code class="text-highlight">Entity</code> is used to refer to all of them.</li>
                <li>There are 2 kinds of <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code>. <span class="text-bold">Link</span> <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> tells which object is linked to which object. It is represented by a line without label on the <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code>. <span class="text-bold">Type</span> <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code> tells which object belong to which type. It is represented by an arrow with label "Object type" pointing to Type object on the <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code>.</li>
                <li>There are 2 kinds of <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>. <span class="text-bold">User properties</span> are fixed <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> that we can create on our own. <span class="text-bold">System properties</span> are dynamic <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> that we can't manually create or delete.</li>
                <li>Every <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> has one and only one <code class="text-highlight">Class</code>. Once a <code class="text-highlight">Class</code> is set for a <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>, it cannot be changed. There are several <code class="text-highlight">Class</code>. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Object</span>, Property has the value of none or more than zero objects whose <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> belongs to a pre-defined list of <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. You can modify this list of <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Text</span>, Property has the value of text. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Number</span>, Property has the value of number (positive, negative number; whole, demical number). With Class of <span class="text-bold">Select</span>, Property has none or one value that belongs to a pre-defined list of options. The value of options is text. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Multi-select</span>, Property has none or more than zero values that belongs to a pre-defined list of options. The value of options is text. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Date</span>: Property has the value of date. The date value can also accompany a time value if users enable "include time". With Class of <span class="text-bold">File & Media</span> - a shorthand version of the class "Object", Property has the value of none or more than zero objects whose <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> belongs to a pre-defined list of <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> which consists of <code class="text-highlight">Image</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Audio</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Video</code>, <code class="text-highlight">File</code>. With Class of <span class="text-bold">Checkbox</span>, Property has the value of either checked or unchecked. This is a useful property for objects like tasks. With Class of URL, Property has none or a valid URL. With Class of Email: Property has none or a valid email address. With Class of Phone, Property has none or a valid phone number.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Object</code> that is pointed to by the arrow with the label "Object" is called <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. The other <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> kind on the other side of the arrow without label is called <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code> (a made-up term for distinguishing). There exist other kinds of <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> which are neither <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> nor <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code>.</li>
                <li>Every existing <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> (not just <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code>) must have a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> and belong to only one <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. This even applies to Type itself. All <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> objects belong to <span class="text-bold">the ultimate Type named "Type"</span>, which will be referred to as <code class="text-highlight">Type (Type)</code>. However, it is not represented on the Graph and cannot be accessed or modified.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Type</code> of <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> is reflected by a system <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> called "<span class="text-bold">Object type</span>". Once an <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> is created with a certain user <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, you cannot change its "Object type" as it is a system property. There is an exception for two special system types that are <code class="text-highlight">Page</code> (<code class="text-highlight">Page</code> objects can be switch to any objects with Format of <span class="text-bold">Page</span>) and <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> (<code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> objects can be switch to any objects with Format of <span class="text-bold">List</span>).</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Type</code> decide the common part that every <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code> belonging to that <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> you wish to share. That common part consists of <span class="text-bold">Format</span>, <span class="text-bold">Templates</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Properties</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Format</span> decides what the structure of all <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code> of that <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> shares is. <span class="text-bold">Layout</span> accompanies Format which you can further specify with some options. It cannot be changed once a user <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> is created.</li>
                <li>There are 2 kinds of <span class="text-bold">Format</span>. <span class="text-bold">Page</span> means the information of an <code class="text-highlight">Instance</code> is organized like a regular document. <span class="text-bold">List</span> means Instance is organized like a table or database which lists all of its linked objects in different <code class="text-highlight">View</code> and allows users to <span class="text-bold">Search</span>, <span class="text-bold">Filter</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Sort</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">View</span> is how you organize the objects inside. Each <code class="text-highlight">View</code> is a combination of <span class="text-bold">View settings</span>, <span class="text-bold">Sort</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Filter</span>.</li>
                <li>There are 6 kinds of <code class="text-highlight">View</code>. <span class="text-bold">Grid</span> displays linked objects with properties in a table format where rows and columns size are automatically aligns. <span class="text-bold">Gallery</span> displays linked objects in a tile format where properties are contained inside objects' tiles. <span class="text-bold">List</span> displays linked objects with properties in a list where the size of them don't line up like columns and rows in "Grid" view.  <span class="text-bold">Kanban</span> displays linked objects in a board format where boards group objects based on certain properties. <span class="text-bold">Calendar</span> displays linked objects in a calendar format where objects are placed on certain dates. <span class="text-bold">Graph</span> displays linked objects in a graph format where relations between linked objects are focused on.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Template</span> are dynamic reusable blueprint for objects within a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. <code class="text-highlight">Template</code> is a special kind of <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>. Whatever the <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> is, all <code class="text-highlight">Template</code> instances belong to the Type named "<span class="text-bold">Templates</span>". However, they share the <span class="text-bold">Format</span> and all properties of the <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> they are associated with. Their association with <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> is nowhere to be found through Property as they do not show up on the <code class="text-highlight">Graph</code>. The association can only be known when you click into that <code class="text-highlight">Template</code> object.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Property</code> of a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> can exist in 3 places: <span class="text-bold">Header</span>, <span class="text-bold">Properties panel</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Hidden</span>. <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> in <span class="text-bold">Header</span> are displayed below the name of an object when you enter it. <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> in <span class="text-bold">Properties panel</span> can be displayed in different View for objects with "Layout" of "List". <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> in <span class="text-bold">Hidden</span> are not displayed and can only be access through Local properties panel. Object can have <code class="text-highlight">Property</code> that are not specified by their <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>. These are call <span class="text-bold">Local properties</span>. They are very helpful when you want to extend a certain group of objects of a Type which have properties that you don't want to include in other objects of that Type.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Type</code> can be further divided into <span class="text-bold">User type</span> and <span class="text-bold">System type</span>. System types can be put into the following groups: <span class="text-bold">Media</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Space Member</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Template</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Collection</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Page</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Query</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>, <span class="text-bold">Bookmark</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Media</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> includes <code class="text-highlight">Audio</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Image</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Video</code>, <code class="text-highlight">File</code>. They are <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> to represent the system files you want to include in your objects.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Space Member</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> represents the members in the space.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Template</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> has been explained above.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Chat</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>: represent conversations.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Collection</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> whose objects are just objects with "Format" of "List". Sometimes it is called "<span class="text-bold">Set</span>" (a non-standard or misnomer name). You can create a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> similar to <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> but the objects of that <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> won't be linked in the <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> "Collection" itself. There is no universal <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> that allows you to access all objects with "Format" of "List". <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> allows its objects to change their <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> but only into <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> with "Format" of "List" by clicking on the property "Object type" inside each object.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Page</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> whose objects are just objects with "Format" of "Page". Sometimes it is called "<span class="text-bold">Note</span>" (a non-standard or misnomer name). You can create a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> similar to <code class="text-highlight">Page</code> but the objects of that <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> won't be linked in the <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> "Page" itself. There is no universal <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> that allows you to access all objects with "Format" of "Page". <code class="text-highlight">Page</code> allows its objects to change their <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> but only into <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> with "Format" of "Page" by clicking on the property "Object type" inside each object.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Query</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> whose objects are similar to <code class="text-highlight">Collection</code> in the fact that they are just objects with "Format" of "List" but automatically link objects based on properties in Filter.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Bookmark</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> whose objects are similar to <code class="text-highlight">Page</code> in the fact that they are just objects with "Format" of "Page" but have a useful property called "<span class="text-bold">Source</span>" which you can input any URL and Anytype will automatically retrieve the icon, the title, and the description of that online resource.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Date</span> <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> whose objects automatically link every <code class="text-highlight">Entity</code> (this includes <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> and <code class="text-highlight">Relation</code>) whose properties with "Class" of "Date" have value of the name of that <code class="text-highlight">Date</code> object. The names of <code class="text-highlight">Date</code> object reflect the date value that will be used to filter linked objects. Every Date object is automatically created by the system and cannot be modified.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Inner layer</span> only exists for object with "Format" of "Page". The inside of those objects where you can write and place your information is called <code class="text-highlight">Document</code>.</li>
                <li>The unit of <code class="text-highlight">Document</code> is <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>. Each block acts as a container that you can apply style, change position and edit content as a whole. When you hover your mouse over the block, there is a white bar on the left which you can use to style and move the block as a whole.</li>
                <li>The unit of <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> is <code class="text-highlight">Text</code>. The text inside a block can have their own style, which can override the style of the block. Inline text can have multiple styling options: <span class="text-bold">bold</span>, <span class="text-bold">italic</span>, <span class="text-bold">strike through</span>, <span class="text-bold">underline</span>, <span class="text-bold">link</span>, <span class="text-bold">text color</span>, <span class="text-bold">background color</span>.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Block</code> exist within a <code class="text-highlight">Row</code>. <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> occupies all space of the row by default when created. When you drag another block into a Row which have other blocks, they now share the same line and occupy an equal space. You can change the space occupied by each block by dragging the column gap between. You can drag the block into an empty <code class="text-highlight">Row</code> to make it fully occupy the <code class="text-highlight">Row</code>.</li>
                <li>There are several kinds of <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>: <span class="text-bold">Text</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">List</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Media</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Embeds</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Document elements</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Objects</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Property elements</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>, <span class="text-bold">Mentioned elements</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code>.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Text</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> contains text. This kind can be one of the following options: <code class="text-highlight">Text</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Title</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Heading</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Subheading</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Highlighted</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Callout</code> (like a quote).</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">List</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> contains text automatically preceded bullets. This kind can be one of the following options: <code class="text-highlight">Checkbox</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Numbered List</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Bulleted List</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Toggle</code>. <code class="text-highlight">Toggle</code> is a special kind of block, which <span class="text-bold">can contain their own content and other block.</span></li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Media</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> contains content that is not text but media. This can be one of the following options: <code class="text-highlight">File</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Image</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Video</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Audio</code>, <code class="text-highlight">PDF</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Bookmark</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Code snippet</code>. Even though these entities can be only created in the inner layer, once they are created, they exist in middle layer and can only be removed in the middle layer even when are references of them in the inner layer have been removed. <code class="text-highlight">PDF</code> is a special case of <code class="text-highlight">File</code>, which can be displayed as full document inside the document interface.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Embeds</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> contains interactive third-party content embedded through a link. The list is exhaustive so you can check within your Anytype app.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Document elements (Other)</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> acts as layout blocks. This can be one of the following options: <code class="text-highlight">Line divider</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Dot divider</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Table of Contents</code>, <code class="text-highlight">Table 3x3</code> (You can resize table later), <code class="text-highlight">Inline Collection</code> (open the Collection inside the Page), <code class="text-highlight">Inline Query</code> (open the Query inside the Page).</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Objects</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> references to objects in the middle layer. This can be one of the following options: <code class="text-highlight">Object</code> (create a button that links to an Object), File (create a button that <code class="text-highlight">opens</code> a File), and <code class="text-highlight">Date</code> (create a button that links to a <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> named <code class="text-highlight">Date</code> with the value of that date), any <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> objects you have created so far.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Property elements</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> references to this <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>'s <code class="text-highlight">Property</code>. You can drag the Property you want to insert into the document from the Properties panel within every object.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Mentioned elements</span> <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> (start with an address sign "@") contains text elements (not occupy the entire block) that display name and link to <code class="text-highlight">Object</code>. This is extremely useful when you are working with recurring names that you want to exist inside <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> as <code class="text-highlight">Text</code> not separately as <code class="text-highlight">Block</code> like the "Object" method above.</li>
                <li>Navigation has 3 layers: <span class="text-bold">Sceen</span>, <span class="text-bold">Window</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Panel</span>.</li>
                <li>If you use Anytype for the first time or just log out, you will see Anytype's <span class="text-bold">Login screen</span> where you can choose "I am new here" to create a new Vault or "I already have a Key" if you want to log in your Vault again. In the top right corner, you can change the <span class="text-bold">Network</span>. "<span class="text-bold">Anytype</span>" network uses Anytype network for backup and synchronization. You are subjected to Anytype's plan. "<span class="text-bold">Local-only</span>" network uses local network for synchronization without cloud backup. "<span class="text-bold">Self-hosted</span>" network uses your own network.</li>
                <li>Anytype can run multiple <code class="text-highlight">Window</code>. Every <code class="text-highlight">Window</code> has "<span class="text-bold">menu bar</span>" for navigation.</li>
                <li><code class="text-highlight">Window</code> has three <code class="text-highlight">Panel</code>, correspondingly from left to right: <span class="text-bold">Left Panel</span>, <span class="text-bold">Middle Panel</span>, <span class="text-bold">Right Panel</span>.</li>
                <li>You can change the size of Left Panel by hovering the right border and dragging it towards left or right when the pointer symbol changes. You can hide this panel by clicking the button on the top left or simply dragging it towards to left border.</li>
                <li>Depending on the context, <span class="text-bold">Left Panel</span> can be in many modes. <span class="text-bold">Settings Panel</span> shows you the respective navigation items depending on Space or Vault settings. <span class="text-bold">Vault Panel</span> contains <code class="text-highlight">Space</code> you own or join. <span class="text-bold">Space Panel</span> contains list of <code class="text-highlight">Widget</code>. <code class="text-highlight">Widget</code> are buttons that show a portion of information about its object and opens that object when you click on it. The order of widget can be changed by dragging them below or above others. Widgets can be expanded to show its linked objects or collapsed.</li>
                <li>There are 4 different views for Widget. "<span class="text-bold">Object view</span>" displays linked objects' names and icons in tiles and each line contains 2 tiles. "<span class="text-bold">Compact list view</span>" displays each linked object's name and icon on a separate line. "<span class="text-bold">List view</span>" displays each linked object' name, icon, and short description on two lines. "<span class="text-bold">Compact widget view</span>" does not display any linked objects.</li>
                <li>Should the number of linked objects exceeds the configured maximum number, there is a small button called "See all" which takes you to fully expanded list of linked objects inside the panel. Widgets of objects with "Format" of "Page" have only 2 kinds of views available: "Object view" and "Compact widget view".</li>
                <li>All widgets exist in two subpanels "<span class="text-bold">Pinned</span>" and "<span class="text-bold">Objects</span>", which can be expanded or collapsed. "<span class="text-bold">Pinned</span>" subpanels are for objects which you have manually pinned them. "<span class="text-bold">Objects</span>" subpanels for objects which are automatically pinned by the systems. Inside it, there is an important object named "<span class="text-bold">Bin</span>" where you can restore and delete permanently deleted objects and properties.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Middle Panel</span> always has an accessible menu on the top.</li>
                <li>Depending on the context, <span class="text-bold">Middle Panel</span> can be in many modes. Document Panel shows up when you enter any object with "Format" of "Page" and it has interface similar to any word processor. List Panel shows up when you enter any object with "Format" of "List" and it has interface similar to databases in some note-taking apps. <span class="text-bold">Settings Panel</span> is where you can change the settings. <span class="text-bold">Object Panel</span> shows the preview of a typical object that belongs to the <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> you are going to create. <span class="text-bold">Graph Panel</span> shows you the "Graph" view of your entire Space or the current object. <span class="text-bold">Flow Panel</span> shows you 3 columns: all objects that are linked to this objects, the current object, and all objects this object is linked to. This is only accessible if you enter the mode "Graph Panel" first then you can switch to "Flow Panel".</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Right Panel</span> is hidden by default.</li>
                <li>Depending on the context, this panel can be in many modes. <span class="text-bold">Properties Panel</span> displays all properties that are put in <span class="text-bold">Properties panel</span> (configured in its <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>). It expands or collapses when you click on the button "Properties" on the top left of the <span class="text-bold">Middle Panel</span>. <span class="text-bold">Type Panel</span> automatically appears when you create a new <code class="text-highlight">Type</code> or edit an existing <code class="text-highlight">Type</code>.</li>

            <h1 class="block-heading1">Application</h1>
            <p class="block-paragraph">If you reach this point, you can see that Anytype offers you a lot of ways to organize your information. However, sometimes when we are offered with a lot of tools, we may waste time selecting the best tools and figuring out the best ways to combine those tools.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">In fact, I only need a week to click with Antytype and explore all of its features but this part, it took me a whole month of trials and redoing experiences to finally come up with a list of general use cases - what tools you should use and in what situtation. I believe this part eats up all of note-takers' time and consequently their productivity the most.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The previous section is for you to learn how to use Anytype efficiently. This section is for you to learn how to use Anytype effectively.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">There are 2 aspects you should consider everytime you use Anytype for something: <span class="text-bold">Object</span> and <span class="text-bold">Information</span>.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Object</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Anytype is object-oriented and its first-class citizen is without doubt: object. Everything piece of information you want to store in Anytype must be about something. It can be concrete things like an item in your house, a person in your life. It can be abstract things like an idea in your head, a note in your work.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">As mentioned above, every object must belong to a type. Types differ from each other based on their format, templates, and properties. Since templates and properties of any type can be made identical to any other type, the only thing meaningful to be considered is the format. Luckily, this has only 2 options that are Page and List. Now, ask yourself this first question: <span class="text-bold">Do you think the object needs document interface?</span></p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">yes</span>, choose "<span class="text-bold">Page</span>". You need document interface when you think the objects of that type have some  information that you want to be uniquely exclusive to them and you don't want that information to be represented by any other linked objects. You only care about the document of the object itself and its potential links with other objects.</li>
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">no</span>, choose "<span class="text-bold">List</span>". You don't need document interface when you want every piece of information of the objects of that type to be represented by any other linked objects. Instead, you care about the properties of object's linked objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-callout callout-note">Think of it like a tree with branches (List) and leaves (Page). Branches can have branches but leaves cannot have leaves nor branches. The leaves are the terminal points of objects. Virtually, you can abstract everything down to its components (that's why I use the phrase "you want" above). A project may be abstracted into its asset, its task, its timeline,… When you want that this is the end of the abstraction, you choose "Page".</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Now, ask the next question: Do you have a type for the object?</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">yes</span>, well, you will <span class="text-bold">decide which type to use for that object</span>. If you have a user type that is specially made for it, go ahead and use it. If you plan to use system types, choose the type "Page" (the type, not the format) if you need document interface and choose the type "Collection" if you don't need document interface. They are very useful when you haven't made your mind yet because they can be converted to other user type later on.</li>
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">no</span>, we will <span class="text-bold">create a new type for it</span>. You decided the Format part then and now, you just need to decide the templates. The properties part will be dicussed in the next part of this section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The last question to ask is: <span class="text-bold">Does the object has any reusable part</span>?</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">yes</span>, you will <span class="text-bold">create a new template</span> if there is no suitable templates in the type or you will <span class="text-bold">choose a suitable template</span> if the list of template.</li>
                <li>If the answer is <span class="text-bold">no</span>, <span class="text-bold">ignore the template</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-callout callout-note">Templates should be decided as soon as possible as you cannot bulk modify the templates of existing objects.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Information</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Anytype is a also note-taking app and its other first-class citizen is without doubt: information. This begs a question: Where do you actually store the information?</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Ultimately, there are two places:</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Property</span>. You can store information on the different properties of objects. This approach is suitable for <span class="text-bold">structured, predictable information</span>.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-underline">Example</span>: information about a person such as height, weight, race, gender,… This information only requires a name, a description, and maybe some pre-defined attributes like relationship, generation,…</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Document</span>. You can store information in objects with "Format" of "Page". This approach is suitable for <span class="text-bold">free-form, unpredictable information</span>.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-underline">Example</span>: information about a note, an idea, an assignment, a project. This information cannot be stored in a fixed space like property description because you may expand the note, the idea into multiple paragraphs in the future.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Regarding the examples above, you can actually swap the approaches and are still able to achieve the result. However, it is terribly ineffective. You can choose to write information about a person like height, weight, race, gender,… in a document, but it is difficult for future retrieval as you have to scan the entire document with your eyes while having the keep the format, position of that information consistent across multiple objects; not to mention the fact that there's no comparison between those objects. The same can be said for the remaining case. You can choose to write information about an idea, a note,… in a property, but there is no format as the only suitable Class is text, no links,… Those alternatives are just terrible.</p>
            <p class="block-callout callout-note">Note that we are dealing with the information you want to store <span class="text-bold">one piece at a time</span>. This means derivative information (information about information) like the topic of the idea you want to store, the context of the person's weight,… should be considered separately.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">If you choose <span class="text-bold">the approach "Property"</span>, you will have to decide the following:</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">How many properties should you reuse and create new?</span></p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Honestly, this is <span class="text-bold">up to your preference and style</span>. Information like the name of a person can be split into surname, middlename, lastname,… or it can be fully contained in a single property called "name".</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">However, my recommendation is that you should aim to <span class="text-bold">create new properties as few as possible</span>. If a piece of information can be represented by a single property instead of two properties, you should just create one.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">The reason for this is that should Anytype include a feature in the future that allows users to create derivative properties (properties whose value derives from other properties' values), it will be much easier to split than to concatenate since you work only on one source of origin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">What are the classes for the properties you intend to create?</span></p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Well, <span class="text-bold">this depends entirely on the nature of your information</span>. With that said, not all classes should be preferred equally. Some put constraints on your properties' values and force you to recreate another property if you happen to encounter an edge case in the future. Believe me, the process of redoing is tedious.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Here is my perference and I have solid reasons for them.</p>
                    <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                        <li>For text-based group: <span class="text-bold">Text > Email, Phone</span>. The reason is simply is that text is the most versatile one. Even though, validation is good in some workplace scenarios, text allows you to type anything that have ressemblance of email and phone. Things are not perfect in reality. Phone numbers may have extensions and different formats.</li>
                        <li>For option-based group: <span class="text-bold">Object > Multi-select > Select > Checkbox</span>. There are several reasons why object is preferred over multi-select. Choosing "Object" class for the property allows you incorporate the whole system of objects and relations onto the property which helps you save time or to easily visualize the whole hierarchy. How so? Imagine you are choosing the class for the property "category" of the products you are going to buy. You may think of Multi-select at first. But, think about this, category has hierarchy: clothing items and jewellry items may belong to fashion items, appliances may belong to household items, electronics,… If you list all of them at the same level, you won't be able to select all the suitable ones if the list gets long. Another reason is that it requires no changes if Anytype releases a new feature that allow you to automatically select all sub-category items if the current category is selected. Multi-select is preferred over Select simply for flexibility. Things are not fully black and white in reality, even for binary concepts like "good", "bad". You don't have to give up the others when you are in two mind. This also helps the Filter not to leave something behind. Select is preferred over Checkbox simply for a range of choices. Again, things are not true or false in real life, even Checkbox's flagship concept like "done" and "not done" can be be expanded into "done", "abandoned", "pending", "planning"…</li>
                        <li>For number-based group: <span class="text-bold">Number > Text</span>. Some people may have a bad practice of putting monetary unit next to the figure like "$5", "€2",… This breaks any number-relation calculation like sum, average, percentage, and possible formula if Anytype includes it in the future. If you want to add currency, consider create a separate property with Multi-select class or Text class.</li>
                        <li>For datetime-based group: <span class="text-span">Date > Text</span>. Again, some people may have a bad practice of choosing text class over date class to represent datetime value for convenience. This breaks not only the ability to use the Calendar view but also the objects of type "Date".</li>
                        <li>For link-based group: <span class="text-span">Object (Type of Bookmark) > URL</span>. This has several reasons. First, "URL" can only have only a single link while "Bookmark" allow you to have multiple links. Second, Anytype's "Bookmarks" has built-in feature of automatically retrieving link's icon, title, and content which proves to be extremely time-saving and better for aesthetic purposes. Last, "Bookmarks" is dynamically linked which means you reuse the same link for other tech and easily change the content of the link which is reflected on all objects while you have to manually change them for "URL".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold"></span>What are the places to put those properties?</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">In the section "Knowledge", we learn that there are 4 places to put properties: <span class="text-bold">Header</span>, <span class="text-bold">Properties panel</span>, <span class="text-bold">Hidden</span>, and <span class="text-bold">Local</span>. The first 3 places don't matter since we can easily switch them. So, the options left are just 2: <span class="text-bold">Local</span> or <span class="text-bold">Global</span> (an umbrella term to refer to any of the first 3 places).</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">ou should choose Global if you think the property is useful across all objects of that type. For example, for objects of the type "Product", universal properties like "Product name", "Price", "Quantity", "Category",… should be global.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">You should choose Local if you think the property is only useful for a portion of objects of that type. For example, for objects of the type "Product", some food products may have particular properties like "Nutrient value", some electronics may have properties like "RAM", "CPU,…</p>
                    <p class="block-callout callout-note">You can still enable Local properties in the views "Grid", "Gallery", "List", or "Kanban". If you enable the local properties for objects which don't have those properties, Anytype automatically list them as empty.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-paragraph">If you choose <span class="text-bold">the approach "Document"</span>, you will have to decide the following:</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">How many documents (objects with "Format" of "Page") should you reuse and create new?</span></p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">This is does not have definite answer. Since Anytype allows you to link any other objects inside a document, you have to decide whether you want to include the information in plain text inside the document or to represent those information through links and elements inside the document.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Information about objects related to "Knowledge" is a typical example. Suppose you want to learn about the topic "Computers". As you learn more and your outline grows, you begin to notice your topic is huge as it can be broken down or related to other concepts like "CPU", "RAM", "Disk", "Operating system",… You will have to decide whether those concepts should stand alone and be linked to the big topic "Computers" or should be included in the big topic "Computers".</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">My recommendation is that you should always include every piece of information you learn about a particular object inside the document of the object at first. In the future, if the need for reusing a piece of information inside that object for other objects arises, you should make that piece of information a stand-alone object and link them. The rule of thumb is to <span class="text-bold">link when needed</span>, not to <span class="text-bold">plan to link ahead</span>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">What are the types for the documents you intend to create?</span></p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">Ok, let's say we decided to split the information into multiple documents. Now, the question is what type of the new documents should be?</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">If you plan to <span class="text-bold">use the same type of the original object</span> for the new documents, then <span class="text-bold">skip this part</span> and go to the next question.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">If you plan to <span class="text-bold">create new type(s) for the new documents</span>, you will have to <span class="text-bold">go back to the part "Object"</span> in this section and <span class="text-bold">go through all of the process</span> again.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">What are the places to put those documents?</span></p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">As mentioned above, there are different ways to link objects into document through different kinds of blocks. However, each kinds of blocks have special uses.</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">If you wish to have <span class="text-bold">continuous piece of text within block</span> without interruption of other blocks, use <span class="text-bold">mentioned elements</span>. This is useful when you are working with objects of "Knowledge", "People", "Events" (date),…</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">If you wish to <span class="text-bold">separate the linked objects</span> with other blocks, use <span class="text-bold">object blocks</span>. This is useful when you want to organize your document into "Dashboard", "User interface", "Navigation panel".</p>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">If you wish to include multiple linked objects that are related to each other, use <span class="text-bold">document elements</span> "Inline Collection" or "Inline Query". Use "<span class="text-bold">Inline Collection</span>" when you want to <span class="text-bold">manually add and remove the linked objects</span>. Use "<span class="text-bold">Inline Query</span>" when you want to <span class="text-bold">dynamically add and remove the linked objects</span>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="block-heading1">Use cases</h1>
            <p class="block-paragraph">In this section, I will demonstrate some use cases along with the tools I use, the approach I choose, and why I make those decisions.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Category-based objects</h2>
            <figure>

                    <span class='text-bold'>Category-based objects</span> use case. The "List" interface of any category objects.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for objects like "Category", "Language", "Country",… Category-based objects can be linked with others while respecting the hierachy that they share. I usually use it as the database to provide options for the equivalent properties with "Class" of "Objects" (The list of types are the types of those category-based objects).</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">They belong to a type named "Category" with "Format" of "List". This is preferred over "Format" of "Page" because I just need basic information about those objects (name and description). Chosen system properties are Name, Description, Links, Backlinks so I can navigate different related objects of a particular object at a time. There exists one important user property with class of "Checkbox" that is "Entry point". "Entry point" is how the Filter know if the categories are top-level (checked) or not (unchecked). Only top-level categories are displayed in the view when you enter the type "Category". If there is no "Entry point", every categories will be displayed and you will feel disoriented to navigate.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/essence-guide/asset/anytype_category-based-object-use-case-template.png" alt="Anytype's Category-based objects use case">

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">All objects share the the same template which is made identical to the view of its type "Category". The settings "Default Type for this View" is the type "Category" itself and "Template for this View" is this template "Category" itself. With this setup, every category-based object looks the same and has the same function. When you want to create new categories, you can either go the the View "All" of the type "Category" to create one and then go to particular existing categories and link the new objects or create them on the spot you plan to link them. </p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Dashboard-based objects</h2>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for objects like "Dashboard", "Command center", "Navigation panel",… Dashboard-based objects are all about presentation and navigation. I usually pin those objects for the widget section of the Left Panel so that I can always navigate in different locations.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">There are two approaches for this:</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">"Collection" dashboard is useful for add and delete new entries in a list layout. View "Gallery" is preferred for aesthetic purpose.

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Calendar-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for time-sensitive objects like "Schedule", "Event",… Calendar-based objects are all about date and time.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Unlike other established note-taking apps, Anytype has not official support the feature "Calendar" yet. What I am doing right here is just workaround: trying to use natively available tools to mimic the behavior of the feature "Calendar" in other apps. Be aware some of its limitations below.</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>Only offers calendar with month view. There is no work-around to change the view into week view or year view.</li>
                <li>Does not support time blocks within a day. The current work-around is to name schedule following a naming scheme so that time blocks are automatically arranged based on Anytype's functionality "Sort" within Calendar view. However, this requires a lot of effort when naming the schedule item and offers no readability when it comes to multiple parallel events.</li>
                <li>Does not support recurring events. The current work-around to do it is to create a template for smaller instances of an event. However, this requires users to duplicate them then change the datetime and the name, thus equally taking the same effort to create a new one.</li>
                <li>Only offers one datetime as the criteria for Calendar view, which is not compatible with events having starting datetime and ending datetime. The current work-around to do it is to make all Occurrence having one unified datetime called "Date target". Any deviation from this reference date is called "Date actual", which has different meaning based on different types of schedule. Additionally, users have to switch between two Calendar views (one for starting date, one for ending date) to visualize the end date and the start date. Furthermore, it's impossible to create events that span more than one single day, which requires multiple occurrence to be set but there is still no way to link them (having to tick multiple boxes to mark them done instead of one box).</li>
                <li>Only offers to display name & description in the "Calendar" view. There is no work-around to know which "Schedule item" the "Occurrence" belongs to.</li>

            <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Calendar</span> is a Query object of Occurrences (identical to the type "Occurrence") based on the property "Date target". It has different views based on Filter of the property "Schedule" of different "Schedule" objects. There are 4 views "Life", "Social", "School", and "Work" corresponding to 4 "Schedule" objects "Life", "Social", "School", and "Work". The settings "Default type for this View" is the type "Occurrence" and "Template for this View" is the template "Occurrence template".</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This approach for Calendar is preferred over using the type "Occurrence" itself because this query can be represented as "Inline Query" in document interface, which is useful to include them in other objects.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Thought-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for objects like "Idea", "Note", "Plan",… This is the most basic and universal use case of note-taking apps.</p>
            <figure>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Personally, I don't create separate types when I am dealing with ideas, notes, or plans. Fundamentally, they all share the "Format" of "Page" which allows users to have a document interface to write out, hence the name "Thought". And that's it. Create a type with "Format" of "Page" and a property named "Thought category" for differentiation. Sometimes, I also include another property "Topic" with "class" of "Multi-select".</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Project-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for "Projects" objects which represent actual projects in real life where you have to complete a list of task or to finish making something. This is the second basic and universal use case of note-taking apps.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Honestly, for this particular kind, I can only show you the method, not a complete use case nor demonstration. Let's get straight into the core idea of "projects": tracking tasks. If it is this easy, you just need to create a type for tasks then add a property with "Class" of "Object" to differentiate tasks accross different projects.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">However, big projects are not just about tracking tasks. They are also about tracking information. What kinds of information? Well, anything. They can be the information about team members who are working on this project; objective/goals that the project must attain; products that this project is working on; established practices like code of conduct, project policy,…</p>
            <figure>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The solution for this is not to include them in the type "Project" iself but rather in separate project-related types (perferably starting with "Project …" in the name" for easier recognition and search). Project is still a type with "Class" of "Page". Those project-related types are represented in the document of "Project" objects through "Inline Query". This has several advantages. First, having document interface, you can easily write out everything without restriction. Second, you can create new objects of those project-related types on the spot of the fully content of your project. Last, since all information exists within the document of "Project" objects, it's easier to create and apply template across Project" objects for consistence layout.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Knowledge-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for "Knowledge" objects which represent anything you want to learn. Surprisingly, Knowledge-based objects and Thought-based objects share huge similarity.</p>
            <figure>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph">I just create a Type named "Knowledge" with "Format" of "Page" so I have the document interface to write out everything I have learned. This type doesn't need template. For properties, I don't even include any additional user properties. For the interface of the type "Knowledge", I two views "Graph view" for easier visualization the relations between "Knowledge" objects and "List view" for easier navigation and removal.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Entity-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for "Entity" objects like "People", "Celebrity", "Friends",… I use it for managing everyone I know and every relationship I have in my life.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">My approach is as the following.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">People</span> is a type with "Format" of "List". Why not "Format" of "Page"? Because people in real life can form different groups and groups can form other bigger groups. Those groups may have separate information and act differently. This is why I prefer the term "Entity" sometimes. For templates, "People" objects share a template that is configured to be identical the type "People" so that it shows a "Grid" view of its linked objects (the people or groups who belong to that group). For properties, the type "People" has a property called "Compositionality" with "Class" of "Select" which tells if the object is an individual or a group. There's a unique "People" object called "Me". This is the object I use to represent me as it is very convenient for Info and Connnection.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">People give rise to <span class="text-bold">Info</span> (Information). Info is a type with "Format" of "Page". For templates, the objects of this type share a simple template that list all of its properties onto the document interface. For properties, this type has a property called "People" with "Class" of "Object" (People) which tells which people this "Info" object belongs to. I also include a property called "Info apsect" with "Class" of "Multi-select":</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>Identity: this person's personal details.</li>
                <li>Form: this person's traits and appearance.</li>
                <li>Health: this person's physical and mental health.</li>
                <li>Mind: this person's guiding living principles.</li>
                <li>Psyche: this person's emotions and inner drives.</li>
                <li>Aptitude: everything this person know and can do.</li>
                <li>Power: this person's influences and resources.</li>
                <li>Mark: this person's achievements and legacies.</li>
                <li>Other: this person's other information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Why not storing the information in properties of People? Well, if you do that, your best "class" would be text, a single-line piece of text, which is not enough for unstructured information. For example, I can store the height of someone in property but I can't not store the context of that information. How does that person have that height? Accidents? Injury? Surgery? The context requires document interface should you need it. Besides, Anytype gets very laggy when you enable many properties as the same time.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Evaluation-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">"Why the hell you would need objects to represent evaluation? Shouldn't we just include a Property with "Class" of "Number" of "Select" to rate everything?" Well yes, this is quite a nuisance. In real life nowadays, everything has too many segments that have too many different products and services and target different customer groups. It's nearly impossible to frame the thing in a single word like "good" or "bad" without relying on the "Halo effect" (It happens when a positive impression of one product, trait, or experience with a brand carries over, leading people to assume that other products or aspects of that brand are also good). The most unbiased, objective way to judge is to evaluate everything only and ignore the maker completely. However, nobody has that enormous amount of time in the world so we will have to make assumptions. This is why we need "Evaluation". It only describes a segment of the thing based on certain criteria. These criteria are left to each individual to find out.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">With that said, the creation of Evaluation-based objects are simple. <span class="text-bold">Evaluation</span> is type with "Format" of "Page". For templates, they share a simple template which lists all of its properties out in the document interface. For properties, they has the following important properties. "Target" with "Class" of "Object" (virtually anything you want to evaluate) describe the target to evaluate. "Evaluation value" with "Class" of "Number" describes the evaluation in numeric value (usually on a scale from 1 to 10).</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">Here's my approach. Routine deals mainly with Activities which are things you on a daily basis. Activity is the combination of the Activity unit which means different facets of information you need to know about the activity. They may differ based on nature of the activity. This gives rise to Catalogs which provide the information for the activity unit. Catalogs exist separately from activities because for every activity, you must track certain profiles, use certain products, have certain certain knowledge, all of which may overlap if you put them inside activities.</p>

Contents are provided through <span class="text-bold">Content sources</span> which come from different <span class="text-bold">Channels</span>. Different Channels may exist on the same <span class="text-bold">Platforms</span>. For Contents, Practices, Festivals, Channels, and Platforms (Interest sources) to exist, they must involve <span class="text-bold">Contributors</span> who have certain <span class="text-bold">Contributor roles</span> which have something to do with Interest source through <span class="text-bold">Contributions</span>.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Contents, Content sources, Practices, Festivals, Contributors, Contributor roles, Contributions, Channels, Platforms (Interest affiliates) have <span class="text-bold">Interest evaluations</span> and <span class="text-bold">Interest achievements</span> which are recognizable awards or titles given by the public or the critics.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-underline">Example</span>:</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You access these works through different Content sources: a YouTube link, a podcast RSS feed, or a DVD purchased from a store. These sources originate from Channels such as dedicated creator pages, podcast stations, or broadcasting outlets, all hosted on Platforms like YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You later engage in a Practice: a focused viewing session of a documentary series. On another day, you switch to a different Practice such as recording your own podcast episode or writing commentary about the show. These Practices anchor the way you not only consume but also contribute to Contents.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Later, you attend an Event: a live premiere screening at a film festival. Unlike digital streaming, this Event can only be experienced at a specific venue and time, bringing the community together in shared anticipation.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The creators behind these works are Contributors. They hold multiple Contributor roles such as director, writer, or performer. These roles are realized through Contributions: a filmmaker contributes directing to the documentary, while a critic contributes commentary to the post-screening discussion. Each Contribution ties a Contributor, their role, and the specific Content where their effort is recognized.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">All these Interest sources such as Contents, Practices, Festivals, Channels, and Platforms exist because of Contributors, their Contributor roles, and their Contributions. They and Content sources are considered Interest affiliates. Each of these elements may receive Interest evaluations such as viewer ratings, critic reviews, or community votes, as well as Interest achievements such as film awards, bestseller lists, or official recognitions that validate their success and impact.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">Music gives rise to Music pieces (such as songs, soundtracks, tales, or speeches), Music tracks inside albums, Music acts that divide albums into sections, Music albums as full collections, and Music playlists curated across works. These Music contents belong to different Music categories, Music genres, and Music themes.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Music is practiced through Music practices such as listening, playing, singing, or composing, and is celebrated in Music festivals which are events that can only be experienced at specific places and times.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Music contents are provided through Music sources which come from different Music channels. Different Music channels may operate on the same Music platforms. For (Interest source) Music contents, Music practices, Music festivals, Music channels, and Music platforms to exist, they must involve Music contributors who have certain Music contributor roles which connect to Music sources through Music contributions.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Music contents, Music sources, Music practices, Music festivals, Music contributors, Music contributor roles, Music contributions, Music channels, and Music platforms (Interest affiliates) are subject to Music evaluations and Music achievements, which are recognizable awards, rankings, or titles given by the public or by critics.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-underline">Example</span>:</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You listen to music. A single Music piece might be a love song released as a digital single, while another piece could be a dramatic film soundtrack or even a spoken-word tale uploaded online. These pieces are arranged as Music tracks inside a pop album, with Music acts dividing the album into upbeat and reflective sections. Together they form the Music album itself, which later inspires Music playlists that mix its songs with tracks from other artists. These Music contents are grouped into Music categories such as "albums" or "playlists", classified into Music genres like "pop", "jazz", or "blues", and shaped by Music themes such as "romance", "war", or "nature".</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You access these works through different Music sources: a Spotify streaming link, a YouTube Music video, or a CD purchased from a store. These sources originate from Music channels such as curated Spotify playlists, radio stations, or independent record labels, all hosted on Music platforms like Spotify, YouTube Music, or Apple Music.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">You engage in a Music practice: a focused listening session of a newly released rock album. On another day, you switch to a different Music practice such as playing the same melodies on piano, singing them with friends, or composing your own short variation. These Music practices anchor the way you not only consume but also create and interact with Music contents. Later, you attend a Music festival: a live concert where multiple bands perform. Unlike digital streaming, this event can only be experienced at a specific venue and time, bringing together the audience in a shared celebration of music.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">The people behind these works are Music contributors. They hold multiple Music contributor roles such as singer, guitarist, or lyricist. These roles are realized through Music contributions: one artist contributes vocals to a single, another contributes a guitar solo, while another provides lyrics for a ballad. Each Music contribution ties a Music contributor, their role, and the specific Music content where their effort is recognized.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">All these Interest sources such as Music contents, Music practices, Music festivals, Music channels, and Music platforms exist because of Music contributors, their Music contributor roles, and their Music contributions. All of theme are considered Interest affiliates. Each of these elements may receive Music evaluations such as listener ratings, critic reviews, or playlist placements, as well as Music achievements such as Grammy Awards, Billboard chart rankings, or festival prizes that validate their success and impact.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading2">Tech-based objects</h2>
            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for technology objects "Web", "App", "Service",… I use it to collect every tech item, mostly digital items, in real life.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Here's my approach. Since there are millions pieces of tech in the market, not to mention that they are rising exponentially, it is virtually impossible to create every type for every piece of tech that we come across, the logical choice would be to create one single type called "Tech" to represent every tech item to collect. This allows us to avoid Recreating the tech in another type if the nature of the tech changes and facing dilemma each time we encounter poly-nature tech, asking which is the most suitable type to represent it (Anytype does not allow creating objects that belong to more than one type).</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">Tech is a type with "Format" of "Page". It has different "Grid" or "Graph" views based on the properties (usually "Tech nature" or "Tech role").

            <p class="block-paragraph">For global properties, they have the following properties.</p>
            <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                <li>
                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Name</span>: this is very important. Bad naming practice can cause you a lot of trouble in the future. Why is it important? Because it is one of the things that help you choose and pick the tech item. Anytype's UI for inserting objects only displays three 3 pieces of information to help you distinguish objects, which are:</p>
                    <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Icon: not too helpful when the tech item doesn't have an icon (Yes! Not all software comes with a GUI, some packages don't even have logos).</li>
                        <li>Object type: is useless because every "Tech" object belongs to the type "Tech".</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">So what is the good way to name it? A good name should:</p>
                    <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Don't be too long</span>. Yes, this is real advice. Beyond a certain length, the rest of the name is cut off from the display in Anytype's UI for inserting object.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Be specific about the nature</span> (or the main feature) of the tech. If the name doesn't tell what it is, you can add nature after it, optionally wrapped in parentheses for aesthetic purpose.</li>
                        <li>Preferably <span class="text-bold">preceded by the name of the brand</span>.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Suggest tech package or tech suite</span> if they exist. If the tech exists in multiple packages, choose the most popular one or ignore this.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Include version or edition</span> if all previous versions or editions are released as "independent" (developers don't encourage using the latest version) products.</li>
                        <li>Should be <span class="text-bold">full form</span> and <span class="text-bold">include abbreviated form if the form is popular</span>. The abbreviated form speeds up the searching process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="block-paragraph">However, there can exist multiple names to call the same piece of tech. My recommendation is that you should follow the following in order to pick the name(s) you want to include:</p>
                    <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Official / formal name</span>: the designation that the organization publishes as the definitive identifier. It appears in specifications, press releases, legal documents, and product packaging.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Abbreviation / short form</span>: a condensed version created for convenience, typically formed from the initial letters of the full name. These are called abbreviations, acronyms (if pronounceable as a word), or initialisms (if spoken letter-by-letter). They serve as shorthand in documentation and conversation.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Nickname / colloquial moniker</span>: a shorter or catchier label that the community adopts organically. These tend to spread through forums, social media, and informal conversation.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Sales / marketing name</span>: the brand-focused label used in advertising, retail listings, and promotional material. Sometimes a product is rebranded for different market segments, resulting in multiple sales names for essentially the same underlying technology.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-bold">Codename</span>: an internal placeholder used during development before a public launch. Codenames are often deliberately opaque to keep upcoming releases under wraps.</li>

Tech description can act as the fourth piece of information to help you distinguish different "Tech" objects in Anytype's UI for searching an object. My recommendation is that you:</p>
                    <ul class="block-list list-bullet">
                        <li>Don't try to cram all information about that "Tech" because you have a whole page to write for each "Tech" already.</li>
                        <li>Should describe the tech nature's concisely. This helps you with the search.</li>
                        <li>Don't include duplicated information that can be stored in the list of common properties. Avoid things like "Tech A is a free, open-source program created in year Y, by person P".</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-bold">Tech variant</span> with "Class" of "Text": this is quite troublesome. Although all variants that change even just one property are encouraged to be reflected in their names, some variants don't have such a great impact. For example, programs that are written in different architectures, built with different flags, used in different modes,…; or serivces that are offered in different channels, rated with different metrics,… They are all still the programs. So this is just a small space for you to include some differences. I ignore this most of the time, to be honest.</p>

In its type, it has a special property called "Entry point" with "Class" of "Number" or "Checkbox" which can take a value number of 1 or empty. This meaningless property is just a shortcut to achieve the view of those "Tech nature" objects sitting at the top of the hierarchy (equivalent to "1"). Why such a thing? When things include other things in a non-filtered view, you get a very disorganized view of things. This property helps show only "objects" you wish to see first and access them.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">This use cases is useful for finance-related like "Personal finance", "Money", "Budget",… Honestly, I don't use it for my personal finance management as the current functionality of Anytype lacks a lot of basic features like calculation, formula, automatic triggers and conditions, reports,… This is just to see how well I could create something similar to personal finance management using Anytype.</p>

            <p class="block-paragraph">With that said, here is my approach for "Wealth". I uses the following types: Accounts, Value units, Currencies, Currency Exchanges, Information sources, Institutions, Payees, Assets, Trackers, Generators, Budgets.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Wealth tracks an individual’s financial world through structured records. Accounts show balances in specific Currencies and are tied to Institutions. Value units allow revaluation of balances across different Currencies through Currency Exchanges, which depend on Information sources. Assets represent properties owned, linked to Inventories, Currencies, Transactions, and alternative Value units. Transactions document financial flows, connected to Accounts, Payees, and Trackers. Trackers group Transactions, while Generators automate recurring financial events. Budgets represent intentional plans for allocating money across Accounts in chosen Currencies.</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph"><span class="text-underline">Example</span>:</p>
            <p class="block-paragraph">Wealth gives rise to Accounts (such as savings accounts, credit card accounts, or loan accounts), tied to Currencies like USD, EUR, or JPY, and managed by Institutions such as banks or digital payment services. Value units provide equivalent balances in other currencies, supported by Currency exchanges using data from Information sources like central banks or financial platforms. Assets such as houses, cars, or jewelry record ownership and value, while Transactions like salary deposits, utility payments, or shopping expenses document account activities. These transactions involve Payees such as employers, landlords, or retailers, tracked with Trackers like electricity bills, shopping expenses, or rent payments. Generators automate repeated events like monthly rent, salary credits, or loan interests. Finally, Budgets such as vacation budgets, food budgets, or education budgets guide intentional use of money across accounts.</p>
